Description of Myself:
I'm originally from Detroit, MI. Have been living in Kentucky since 2010. 
I have a BA in English and a MPA.
Have always been into computers and technology at a casual level, but want to engage with it more, that's why I'm really glad I found this program. 
I'm very excited to learn more about coding and becoming a programmer. 
I have a strong personal interest in Game Development, but I'm unsure if that's the route I want to do for the program yet.
